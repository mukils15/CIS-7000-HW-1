My game is about an adult at a grocery store who has his kids and spouse waiting in the car for him while he picks up everything that they need. He doesn't usually like grocery shopping, but this time his kids and spouse have given him a long list of things to purchase, including vegetabloes, lemon yogurt, and allergy medicines. He also wants to get flowers for his spouse, as he has somewhat been in the doghouse recently for not doing chores. However, during his time at the grocery store, he meets some characters that make his life a little more difficult. The game ends when he has all of the necessary items. I chose this game because it is similar to a situation I am in all the time when I am home (I'm at the grocery store with a gigantic list from my parents, and I encounter random people from the neighborhood).
